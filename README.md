# Melt Next

Next generation of Melt UI.

Focus on simplicity and flexibility. Ships builders, but also components powered by builders.
Alternatively, just use the returned builder instance from the component.

Controlled usage in builders, in components, everywhere.

This is not an agnostic implementation. Let's leverage the best of runes.

Keep it simple. No super advanced examples or extra features. Just well documented components.
The future comes afterwards.
